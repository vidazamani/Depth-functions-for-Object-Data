# Depth Functions for Object Data

This project contains code to reproduce the results of the paper named 'Metric Oja Depth, New Statistical Tool for
Estimating the Most Central Objects' by Zamanifarizhandi, V. and Virta, J.

The goal of the project was to develope a novel measure of statistical depth, the metric Oja depth applicable to any object data. 

All code here is written in R and requires the packages CovTools, ICtest, parallel, fda, ggplot2, ggpattern, ggpubr and ggsci.

## Why this project is useful for you?!
If you're working with complex datasets, such as matrices or images, the following main functions can help you identify the most central objects within your data. Simply calculate the distances between objects and apply them as an input in our metric functions.

### The main metric functions are:

MLD, MHD, MSD, MOD2, MOD3

In addition the project contains several helper functions for data generation, computing p-value for real dataset examples and the simulations performed in the paper.
